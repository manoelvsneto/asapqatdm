# Justification for Classifying Respondents into Patterns (Q5) (Translated from another language)

| Pattern                         | Respondent | Justification                                                                                                                      |
|---------------------------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Empirical / Subjective          | RESP14     | Values quality from the beginning, but based on personal perception; lacks formal criteria, metrics, or guidelines.               |
|                                 | RESP3      | Mentions "agreement on minimum conditions" without detailing criteria; implicit approach based on team experience.                |
|                                 | RESP4      | Explicitly states that no structured process exists; each architect decides based on their own empirical experience.              |
| Reactive / Post-failure         | RESP10     | Quality is addressed within time constraints; what is not done becomes technical debt — reactive response to context.             |
|                                 | RESP14     | Assumes that poor initial quality will be “scaled up”; adjustments are made only after production issues arise.                   |
|                                 | RESP3      | Release conditioned on minimum conditions, without robust preventive practice — indicates a corrective tendency.                  |
|                                 | RESP2      | Functionality comes first, followed by tests and performance — explicitly reactive quality management post-delivery.              |
| Initial Functionalism           | RESP14     | Focused on delivering a functional MVP, even if quality is not ideal; assumes later escalation.                                   |
|                                 | RESP5      | Although mentions several pillars, in practice prioritizes reliability and maintainability in the MVP.                            |
|                                 | RESP6      | Only structural elements (e.g., DDD) are considered; no concern with quality in the first version.                                |
|                                 | RESP8      | Focus on rapid delivery with gradually increasing structure; no mention of formal control of quality attributes.                  |
|                                 | RESP2      | Declares that functionality comes first, and only later are quality measures applied.                                             |
| Pragmatic / Minimal Engineering | RESP12     | Describes palliative measures, lack of technical training, and variation between projects — ad hoc solutions, not systematic.     |
|                                 | RESP6      | Applies DDD and unit tests, but without a comprehensive architectural practice for quality.                                       |
|                                 | RESP9      | Applies basic good practices (clean code, tests, containers), but does not mention use of models, metrics, or tools.             |
| Structured / Systematized       | RESP11     | Describes advanced practices such as QA, automated testing, SonarQube coverage, and validation via pull requests.                 |
|                                 | RESP13     | Systematically enumerates quality attributes and corresponding actions; indicates control and maturity.                          |
|                                 | RESP5      | Points to formal mapping of pillars and use of practices to avoid technical debt — indicates a structured approach.              |
|                                 | RESP7      | Mentions the use of Dynatrace, UX practices, development standards, and specialized teams from project inception.                 |
|                                 | RESP9      | Goes beyond minimal engineering, including deployment in containers and robust operational requirements.                         |
|                                 | RESP1      | Mentions reference models, peer reviews, and continuous architecture refinement — elements of a structured architectural practice.|
