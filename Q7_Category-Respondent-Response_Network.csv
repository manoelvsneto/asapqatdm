Business-Based Prioritization,RESP2,"They are prioritized according to business demands; if we have an important business requirement, the debt is prioritized for the next sprint."
Business-Based Prioritization,RESP4,"There is a minimally structured process for managing technical debt, where the architect and the team log the debts on the team board so they can be prioritized together with the business stakeholders. There is no data-based process for prioritization; it depends on everyone's sense of value and urgency."
Business-Based Prioritization,RESP5,"Technical debts are identified during development or while analyzing system behavior, and addressed based on their criticality and backlog availability."
Business-Based Prioritization,RESP6,"After software deployment, technical debt activities are treated like any other development item. They are prioritized among other value-delivery tasks. This creates a conflict between what should be done to improve quality (with no direct business value) and what delivers financial return. As a result, technical debts are often addressed too late or forgotten."
Business-Based Prioritization,RESP9,"Technical debts are prioritized based on business needs. If a debt affects a system functionality, it is prioritized. Other debts are handled as they “fit” into the daily workflow, or the architect takes them on directly."
Business-Based Prioritization,RESP10,"Once identified, technical debt items are added to the backlog of the responsible team and prioritized jointly with the Product Owner, who understands the debt's impact on the product."
Business-Based Prioritization,RESP11,"We usually map the problems — whether from bugs or not — assess their criticality and impact on the application, and weigh that against features to more healthily prioritize the technical debt. This helps us address those with the highest product impact."
Alignment with Technical Leadership/PO,RESP1,Technical debts are addressed by the architect together with the team and the Product Owner so that they can be resolved as quickly as possible.
Alignment with Technical Leadership/PO,RESP3,"In general, these activities are based on negotiations with the PO. There is a defense of the importance and criticality, and also moments when debt-related activities must be done. Hypothetical example: the first release of an application does not use a certificate, but from a certain date 'X', it will be required by law. The application starts with this debt, perhaps due to deadlines or delays in purchasing the certificate. However, when the time comes, the debt must be paid."

Alignment with Technical Leadership/PO,RESP13,Through alignment with leaders (TL/PO/PM) and squads to define implementation prioritization.
Backlog and Sprints,RESP6,"After software deployment, technical debt activities are treated like any other development item. They are prioritized among other value-delivery tasks. This creates a conflict between what should be done to improve quality (with no direct business value) and what delivers financial return. As a result, technical debts are often addressed too late or forgotten."
Backlog and Sprints,RESP7,"Technical debts are raised by the architect or development team and prioritized in upcoming sprints, in alignment with the institution’s intentional architecture strategy."
Backlog and Sprints,RESP10,"Once identified, technical debt items are added to the backlog of the responsible team and prioritized jointly with the Product Owner, who understands the debt's impact on the product."
Backlog and Sprints,RESP14,"There is usually some resistance to prioritizing technical debt within the squads, and we always need to advocate for higher code quality, efficiency, and maintainability — all of which add much more value for the customer and streamline the entire process. We are currently working to include at least one technical debt activity in each team sprint."
Mapping and Criticality,RESP3,"In general, these activities are based on negotiations with the PO.

Neglect and Invisibility,RESP6,"After software deployment, technical debt activities are treated like any other development item. They are prioritized among other value-delivery tasks. This creates a conflict between what should be done to improve quality (with no direct business value) and what delivers financial return. As a result, technical debts are often addressed too late or forgotten."
Neglect and Invisibility,RESP8,"We address issues related to security and reliability fragility, ensuring high maintainability."
Neglect and Invisibility,RESP12,"They are rarely remembered. Some teams are committed to resolving them, but most ignore them. Often, a task force is needed to “clean the backlog” and delete debts that have become obsolete. Sometimes a top-down action is needed to enforce adjustments for shared debts, such as adopting a specific version of a service or product."
